# Fix for Model Loading Error - ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem
The error `Can't get attribute '_RemainderColsList'` occurs due to a **NumPy version incompatibility**. The environment had NumPy 2.3.x, but scikit-learn and the saved model were incompatible with this version.

## ✅ Solution Applied

The issue has been **FIXED**! Here's what was done:

1. **Downgraded NumPy** from 2.3.x to 1.26.4 (compatible version)
2. **Retrained the model** with the correct environment
3. **Verified** the model loads successfully

## Current Status

✓ NumPy 1.26.4 installed  
✓ Model retrained and saved  
✓ Model loads without errors  
✓ Ready to use  

## Files Updated

- `model_trainer.py` - Improved with better error handling and directory creation
- `app.py` - Enhanced error messages
- `requirements.txt` - Added version constraints to prevent future issues
- `retrain_model.py` - New standalone script for easy retraining
- Model files regenerated in `./model/` directory

## Next Steps

**Restart your Streamlit app:**
```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

The model should now load correctly and you can make predictions!
