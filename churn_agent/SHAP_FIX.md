# SHAP Explanation Error - FIXED âœ…

## Issue
**Error:** `too many indices for array: array is 1-dimensional, but 2 were indexed`

## Root Cause
The error occurred when trying to create SHAP explanations. The issue was in how the code handled SHAP values:

1. **Different SHAP formats**: `KernelExplainer.shap_values()` can return different formats:
   - List of arrays: `[negative_class_values, positive_class_values]`
   - 3D array: `(n_samples, n_features, n_classes)`
   - 2D array: `(n_samples, n_features)`

2. **Incorrect indexing**: The code tried to access `shap_values[1]` assuming it was always a list, but newer SHAP versions return a 3D array.

3. **Base value handling**: The base values also needed proper handling for different formats.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `predictor.py`
- Added comprehensive handling for all SHAP value formats
- Added proper dimension checking before indexing
- Ensured base values are scalars
- Added numpy import for array type checking

### 2. Updated `app.py`
- Changed from `shap.force_plot()` to `shap.plots.waterfall()` for single predictions
- Changed from `shap.summary_plot()` to `shap.plots.beeswarm()` for batch predictions
- Added proper matplotlib figure handling with `show=False`
- Added error traceback for better debugging

## Test Results

âœ… **All tests passing:**

### Basic Prediction Test
```
customer_id  churn_prediction  churn_probability
       C001                 0           0.023337
       C002                 1           0.906899
       C003                 0           0.010365
```

### SHAP Explanation Test
- âœ… Values shape: (3, 16) - Correct 2D array
- âœ… Waterfall plot generated successfully
- âœ… Beeswarm plot ready for batch predictions

### Streamlit Workflow Simulation
- âœ… Manual input data processed correctly
- âœ… Prediction: C12345 with 5.84% churn probability
- âœ… SHAP waterfall visualization created

## Files Modified

1. **predictor.py**
   - Added `import numpy as np`
   - Enhanced `predict_and_explain()` with comprehensive SHAP value handling
   - Added proper type checking and dimension handling

2. **app.py**
   - Updated manual prediction SHAP visualization to use waterfall plot
   - Updated CSV prediction SHAP visualization to use beeswarm plot
   - Added better error reporting with tracebacks

## Files Created

1. **test_shap_viz.py** - Tests SHAP visualization generation
2. **test_streamlit_workflow.py** - Simulates exact Streamlit workflow
3. **test_waterfall.png** - Example waterfall plot output
4. **streamlit_simulation_waterfall.png** - Streamlit workflow test output

## How to Use

### Restart Streamlit
```powershell
# Stop current app (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
streamlit run app.py
```

### Make Predictions
1. Fill in the manual input form
2. Click "Predict Churn (Manual)"
3. View results with interactive SHAP waterfall visualization

### Visualizations
- **Manual Input**: Waterfall plot (shows feature contributions for single prediction)
- **CSV Upload**: Beeswarm plot (shows feature importance across multiple predictions)

## Status
âœ… Model loading: Working  
âœ… Predictions: Working  
âœ… SHAP explanations: Working  
âœ… Visualizations: Working  
âœ… All tests: Passing
