# Churn Prediction System - Fixed and Tested ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Model Loading Error
**Problem:** `Can't get attribute '_RemainderColsList'`  
**Cause:** NumPy 2.x incompatibility with scikit-learn  
**Solution:** Downgraded NumPy to 1.26.4 and retrained model  

### 2. ✅ Prediction Error
**Problem:** `index 1 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 1`  
**Cause:** Code assumed `predict_proba` always returns 2 columns  
**Solution:** Added robust handling for edge cases in predictor  

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

1. **predictor.py**
   - Added safe handling for `predict_proba` output shape
   - Added checks for single vs multi-class predictions
   - Improved SHAP value handling for different output formats

2. **model_trainer.py**
   - Added explicit `remainder='drop'` in ColumnTransformer
   - Added directory creation logic
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Return trained model for verification

3. **requirements.txt**
   - Added `numpy<2.0` constraint
   - Added `joblib` explicitly
   - Added version hints for stability

4. **app.py**
   - Improved error messages
   - Added success indicator when model loads
   - Clear user guidance for fixing issues

### Files Created

1. **retrain_model.py** - Standalone script for easy model retraining
2. **test_predictor.py** - Comprehensive test suite
3. **FIX_MODEL_ERROR.md** - Documentation of fixes

## Test Results

✅ **All tests passing:**
- Model loads successfully
- Basic predictions work correctly  
- Predictions with SHAP explanations work
- Handles various customer profiles

**Example output:**
```
customer_id  churn_prediction  churn_probability
       C001                 0           0.023337
       C002                 1           0.906899
       C003                 0           0.010365
```

## How to Use

### Start the application:
```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

### Make predictions:
1. Select "Manual Input" mode
2. Fill in customer data
3. Click "Predict Churn (Manual)"
4. View results and explanations

### Retrain model if needed:
```powershell
python retrain_model.py
```

### Run tests:
```powershell
python test_predictor.py
```

## System Status

✅ NumPy version: 1.26.4 (compatible)  
✅ Model: Trained and verified  
✅ Predictions: Working correctly  
✅ SHAP explanations: Working correctly  
✅ All test cases: Passing  

## Next Steps

Your Streamlit app should now work without errors. You can:
1. Make predictions using the manual input form
2. Upload CSV files for batch predictions
3. Use the real-time prediction simulator
4. Train new models with your own data from BigQuery

**Note:** Make sure to refresh your Streamlit app if it's still running to pick up the changes.
